| Name | Role | More about us |
|:-----|:-----|:--------------|
| [Bryan Olsson](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/contributors/CMLZ_n1lNNSfQScLGE2yBmlS55w/) | Project Manager: Firefox Desktop, Mozilla Accounts, Terminology | I’m passionate about localization and technology, and so excited to support our Mozilla community in making the internet accessible in as many languages as possible. Ask me anything about Firefox desktop or Mozilla localization technologies. |
| [Delphine Lebédel](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/contributors/3LPn77ppB_IQ9F6ruL5lw2IVrvQ/) | Project Manager: mobile (Android and iOS). | I work closely with the volunteer community, and am eager to help it thrive and grow. I speak French, English and Spanish. Come talk to me about mobile and any community ideas and projects. |
| Eemeli Aro | Staff Software Engineer | I maintain and develop all the parts of our localization systems that aren’t Pontoon (though I help out with that as well). I’m also rather involved in a bunch of localization standards work, including the MessageFormat 2 spec at Unicode. |
| [Francesco Lodolo](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/contributors/mZuzEFP7EcmgBBTbvtgJP2LFFTY/) | Team Manager | I started my localization adventure with Mozilla in 2004, joining the Italian community to help translate and localize support content. In 2013, I made the leap from volunteer to staff member. Since then, I’ve worn many hats and taken on various projects. These days, I manage the L10n team. When I’m not working or translating, you can find me enjoying cakes or doing some sport to burn off the extra calories. |
| Harmit Goswami | Software Engineer Intern | Passionate about improving the Internet! I study Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto, and I can speak Gujarati, English, French, and some Hindi. |
| Matjaž Horvat | Localization Engineer | I develop Pontoon. In my free time I help localize Mozilla to Slovenian. Happy to chat with you about Pontoon, as well as broader localization tech stack at Mozilla. |
| [Peiying Mo](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/contributors/jIdunhnZ8Edgi9npILuSoFvf5ZY/) | Localization Program Manager and Vendor Manager. | Besides working with communities to localize mozilla.org, I also work with translation agencies to support Mozilla’s localization needs. Contact me if you need the service or if you want to report translation issues. |
